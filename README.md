# SJSU Cube3 Satellite Club - Mission Control Dashboard

Welcome to the official repository for the **Mission Control Dashboard** developed by the **SJSU Cube3 Satellite Club**. This web-based dashboard allows operators at mission control to monitor the real-time status of our CubeSat during operations.

## üåê Project Overview

The **Mission Control Dashboard** is an application that displays the telemetry, system status, and operational metrics of our CubeSat. It connects to ground station systems to receive real-time data, which is processed and presented to operators for decision-making during satellite missions.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Telemetry**: Display of live data including CubeSat orientation, power levels, and subsystem health.
- **Event Logging**: Historical logs of important events during the mission for diagnostics and analysis.
- **Command Interface**: Interface for sending commands to the CubeSat from mission control.
- **Alert System**: Warnings and alerts for critical system failures or low-power situations.
- **Responsive UI**: A user-friendly, intuitive interface for mission operators, optimized for both desktop and mobile.
